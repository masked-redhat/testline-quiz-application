# Internship Task

Quiz Application

Frontend - React + Tailwind + React Router
Backend - Express + Node

## Why Backend?

Because react wouldn't let fetch other apis, and in 'no-cors' mode, the result wouldn't be readable

## Dockerize application

Use `docker compose up` to start the application
than visit `http://localhost:3000` to run the application on your local server
